# Languages 
## What is a programming language?
- Defined by structure, rules that dictate its use, what is valid within the language.
- Very similar to a natural language.
- To create a language we need to write a _grammar_ which describes it and then create a tool that validates that the input fits into our languages allowed grammar.
