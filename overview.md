# Overview of C
## Programs
- A program in C consists of _function definitions_ and _structure definitions_.
- A source file is, therefore, simply a list of _functions_ and _types_.
- The execution of a C program always starts in the `main` function. From here it abstracts away processes by calling other functions.
## Variables
- Items of data which we give a name to.
- Every variable in C has an explicit _type_. These types are declared by ourselves or built into the language.
- You declare a new variable by writing the name of its type, followed by its name, and optionally setting it to some value using `=`.
